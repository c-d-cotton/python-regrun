# Setup
Run setup_submodules.sh to add in required submodules.

# Basic steps for running multiple similar regressions.
1. Generate matrices for regressions.
2. Run regressions.
3. Save/append basic results of regressions in tex/txt form.
4. Construct tabular summary of many regressions.
5. Take tabular and construct table summary.

I also have a simple function that does all of this in one go for OLS.
